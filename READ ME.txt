
Dear Boyfriend,

Sorry for leaving you back there. Make sure to be happy without anyone in the universe.
All of the people including dad, mom, Hex, Whitty, Garcello (he isn't in Ghost McDonalds), Sarvente, Ruv, and more also myself are gone.
You are the only one's left in the universe. Be happy without us okay?
Don't worry, I am sure that in the future, we'll be back again.
Stay safe okay? Love you!
